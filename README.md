# Sungdrum

*Sungdrum* is a (nascent) project to standardize and improve the representation of lyrical and linguistic data in computational musicology datasets, focusing on (and advocating for) data encoded in the [humdrum](https://www.humdrum.org){target="_blank"} syntax.
Sungdrum is based in "classic" humdrum syntax/toolkit, but is (or will be) particularly integrated with [humdrumR](https://humdrumr.ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/){target="_blank"}.

This repo contains several documents containing recommendations about lyric/linguistic encodings and workflows, as well as some scripts to help with the annotation of lyrics in humdrum data.


> Sungdrum is a project of the Georgia Tech [Computational and Cognitive Musicology lab](https://ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu){target="_blank"}, led by PI Nat Condit-Schultz.

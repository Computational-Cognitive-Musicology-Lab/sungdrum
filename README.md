# Sungdrum

*Sungdrum* is a (nascent) project to standardize and improve the representation of lyrical and linguistic data in computational musicology datasets, focusing on (and advocating for) data encoded in the [humdrum](https://www.humdrum.org) syntax.
Sungdrum is based in "classic" humdrum syntax/toolkit, but is (or will be) particularly integrated with [humdrumR](https://humdrumr.ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/).

This repo contains several documents containing recommendations and standards for lyric/linguistic encodings and workflows, as well as some scripts to help with the annotation of lyrics in humdrum data.
The main contribution at this time, is a set of new standards for encoding lyrical and linguistic data in humdrum syntax.

+ [Issues with lyric data](Issues.md) (problems)
+ [Humdrum representations](Representations.md) (solutions)

> This project is still underdevelopment. I'll hopefully be refining my recommendations, and pushing some useful tools this Fall (2025).
